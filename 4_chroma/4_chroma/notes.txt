Ex 1)
 Need spec to pitch matrix

 Spectrogram is |X(n,k)|^2
 C_fp * Spectrogram = pitch-o-gram

Given a pitch, can figure out corresponding k values
So if we want to figure out the energy from a given pitch class, 


There are different types of pitch we are working with
 1. Good old frequeny, in Hz
 2. Midi pitch, which increases by 1 for each half step
 3. k bins, which represent harmonics
    of the original value?
  
What do k bins correspond to?
 When taking a DTFT, there are N samples
 N samples -> N k vals
 k = 0 -- corresponds to DC energy
 k = 1 -- fundamental frequency
 k = k -- frequency * k 

So this is all relative to the number of samples N

Imagine the fourier transform as measuring similarity with a bunch of sine waves

It will try a total of N sine waves 
 The frequencies of the test sine waves will increase with n
 Each test sine wave will have increasing frequency
 The nth test sine wave will have n periods from 0 to N

DTFT f: R^n --> R^n
STFT g: R^n --> R^(nxnum_hops)

Spectrogram converts STFT into energy measurements

Want fxn from Spectrogram to pitchogram
 Pitchogram reorganizes spectrum vector (R^n) into pitch vector (R^12)
 In order to do this, need mapping from k to pitch

In the kth slot, there are k periods over N samples
N samples take N/Fs seconds
k periods / (N/Fs) seconds -> k cycles / (N/Fs) seconds

Therefore frequency = k*Fs/N (cycles/second)

To test this knowledge, implement bins_of_pitch() and ex 9
 From lab4

Bins of pitch successful
Next create pitchogram from C2 to C8 (36 to 108 MIDI)
 Ensure every pitch bin can draw from >= 2 freq bins of the spectrogram
Success

Ex 1) spectrogram --> pitchogram
Spectrogram is in columns indexed by k vals
Need to remap k's to pitches

Have starting and ending MIDI pitches
Have: MIDI --> k_bins
So get a list of k_bins for each MIDI pitch

Use that to convert spectrogram to pitchogram
spectrogram: N x num_hops
pitchogram: 12 x num_hops
cfp: 12 x N

Should I do it with pitches indexed as their actual values?
 Or just based on order

Got answer
 How can I check that this is correct
 Can potentially step through the chroma lab
 




But we start with pitches, so may have to g in reverse
